                "Those times when you get up early and you work hard, those
                times when you stay up late and you work hard, those times when
                you don't feel like working, you're too tired, you don't want to
                push yourself, but you do it anyway. That is actually the dream.
                That's the dream. It's not the destination, it's the journey.
                And if you guys can understand that, then what you'll see happen
                is you won't accomplish your dreams, your dreams won't come
                true; something greater will."
